We have provided an excel sheet with a list of clients on it for you.
We would like you to write up a query to extract the following details. You can use either SQL or MySQL as the language.

•	ID	
•	FIRST_NAME	
•	LAST_NAME	
•	GENDER	(must be “M” or “F”)
•	MOBILE	
•	SMS_CONSENT	(for marketing, must be “Y” or “N”)
•	LANDLINE	
•	EMAIL	
•	ADDRESS1	
•	ADDRESS2	
•	TOWN	
•	COUNTY	
•	COUNTRY	
•	POSTCODE	
•	BIRTHDAY (must be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD)	
•	CLIENT_SINCE (must be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD)	
•	SOURCE_ID	
•	NOTES	
•	EMAIL_CONSENT (for marketing, must be “Y” or “N”)

We only need a list of clients who are not archived or deleted.
